Hi! I am a graphics researcher at Ubisoft Montréal La Forge. A PhD graduate in computer graphics at the Laboratoire d'informatique graphique of the Université de Montréal (LIGUM) my research interests include real-time rendering, light transport, graphics hardware, distribution effects, and virtual reality. I have previously conducted research in collaboration with Autodesk, Pixar, Meta Reality Labs and Ubisoft.
